# Neural-Networks-for-Spoken-Digits-Recognition
This repositoy will demonstrate a project that is about a preliminary attempt for a utilization of different powerful tools, mainly neural network and machine learning, to create a simple-function speech recognition tool that can distinguish number 1 to 9 with a decent accuracy.
